    comment: 'The hosts are very friendly and nice. The room is also very cozy and clean. It is just a bit of walking from the bus or metro stations, but considering the price it is very reasonable. You also get your own toilet, but you might want to bring your own toothpaste, shampoo etc. But the hosts will let you borrow them if you ask.',
